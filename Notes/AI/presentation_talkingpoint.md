## Intro
This work aims to find the scenarios where EUH does not align with human intuition. Understand why this is, and look at other better ways of estimating human behaviour, such as 


## Axioms
Hopefully everyone remembers the axioms of utility, we don't have time to go through them in detail, but we will quickly recap their names. They are

* Orderability
* Transitivity
* Continuity
* Substitutability
* Monotonicity
* Decomposability

## Anchoring
Next we get to the anchoring effect. This is when some initial reference point impacts decision making, and can lead to very irrational decisions. This effect was clearly shown in an experiment where teenagers were split into two groups. Both groups were asked the same question, try to calculate this expression as fast as possible. One group was given the expression you see at the top while the other group was given the expression you see at the bottom, clearly the correct results are the same. But despite this the group which were given the numbers in ascending order, as seen above had a median guess of 512, while the other group had a median answer of 2250. Clearly this behavior is not rational as some arbitrary anchoring point should not change the choice. 

## Framing
A similar effect to the anchoring effect is the framing effect. This is the idea that the way information is presented has an impact on what decision is made. This idea is easiest to show using an example. In this example we once again split the people into two different groups. Both groups play a lottery. The first groups lottery looks like this. It will contain two different rounds, as you can see here at the top. The odds of moving on from that round are 25%. Before the game can start the person must say if they wish to go for a risky bet if they get to the second round. Note that this decision must be made before the round starts. If they agree to this decision they will be part of a second lottery if they manage to reach the second round, here there is a 80% chance that they win. Assuming they win the risky bet they will get $40, assuming they chose not to go for the risky bet they will instead win $30. And obviously if they lose the get nothing. 

The second group instead get this lottery, they are also asked if they want to take the risky choice, if they take the risky choice they have a 20% chance of winning $40, the non risky choice they instead have a 25% chance of winning $30. From the axioms of utility we know that the first lottery can be decomposed into the second lottery. So they are the same question simply asked in a different way. But despite this the results between the two groups varied a lot. In the group which were given the two round version of the game 78% chose the safe option, while this was 42% for the group with only 1 round. 

## Sunk Cost
Finally we get to the sunk cost fallacy. This is the phenomenon where people make a choice with a lower utility because they feel they have already made some sacrifice. This is in some way similar to what Johannes spoke of earlier, where not only the clear utility of a impact but also the feelings which come along with it. I imagine most people have felt this is some part of their life. Imagine having spent money on a concert ticket, but the day of the concert it's raining. You might not want to go, but do it anyway as you feel you've already paid.
