# Statistical methods in data science and AI
We will talk about Bayesian statistics and graphical models. 

Probability predicts the likelihood of a future event. Statistics is the opposite problem, we get estimate the frequency of past events. 

A random experiment is a process that produces random outcomes. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes in an experiment. An event is the outcome, or a subset of all possible values. 

Using a die as an example. Sample space S = {1..6}. Event can be "At least 3", "Odd" or "Six". We can then calculate the probabilities of different events. There are events which are mutually exclusive. 

Conditional probability the the probability of something happening given that we know that something else has happened. This can be calculates using $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}$. 

Bayes' theorem: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(B)}$

One core idea in Bayesian reasoning is that we can update our believes based on new information.

There are a number of common distribution 
* Uniform
* Binomial
* Geometric
* Hypergeometric
* Poisson
* Negative binomial
