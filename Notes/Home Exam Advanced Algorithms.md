I will consider a number of different approaches to find an approximation ratio to this problem. 

## Greedy Approximation
First I shall consider some greedy approximations to this problem. 

### Greedy Algorithm 1
Let's start with a simple greedy algorithm. Loop over all available nodes and calculate the sum of the edges connected to the node. Place the most expensive node at $(0,0)$. From here we will continue to add nodes based on the total sum of their edges.  


## Randomization algorithms
Next lets consider a few randomization algorithms.
