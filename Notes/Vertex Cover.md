# Vertex Cover
G = (V,E) graph. Vertex cover is $C \subseteq V$ such that the nodes are incident to all nodes. 
ADD IMAGE 2. 

This is also a NP-complete problem, but it can be approximated well! Matching: M $\subseteq$ E, pairwise disjoint. So edges which do not share a node. 

For  normal approximation see [[Approximation_Algorithms]]
