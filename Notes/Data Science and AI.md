# Data Science and AI
Data science is concerned with extracting meaning from data. Central topics in data science include: 
* Data mining
* Machine learning 
* Databases
* Application of data science on natural sciences, life sciences, industry and society. 

### 3 groups of problems: 
* Classification: Assign a label from a discrete set of possibilities. Supervised problem. 
* Regression: Predicting a numerical value. Supervised problem.
* Clustering: Grouping items by similarity. Unsupervised problem. 

Supervised means we have both image and label available. So meaning we know what different classes might exist.
