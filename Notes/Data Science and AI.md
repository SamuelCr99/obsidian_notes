# Data Science and AI
Data science is concerned with extracting meaning from data. Central topics in data science include: 
* Data mining
* Machine learning 
* Databases
* Application of data science on natural sciences, life sciences, industry and society. 

### 3 groups of problems: 
* Classification: Assign a label from a discrete set of possibilities. Supervised problem. 
* Regression: Predicting a numerical value. Supervised problem.
* Clustering: Grouping items by similarity. Unsupervised problem. 

Supervised means we have both image and label available. So meaning we know what different classes might exist. 

### Stratification 
Dividing data into homogeneous sub-populations before analysis. There variables could be gender, age, socio-economic status. This can lead to new insights. Here is an example:

* Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of values. 
* Variance: Average squared deviations from the mean for a set of values.
* Mode: The value that occurs most frequently in a set of values. 
* Averages are appropriate for unimodal distributions. 
* For bimodal and multi-model distributions, the average might occur where there are no observations.
