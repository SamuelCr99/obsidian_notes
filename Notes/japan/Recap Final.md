First we will cover Japanese history. 

## Early Japanese periods 

#### Jomon Period (10000 BCE - 300 BCE)
The people in Japan live in hunter gatherer societies, despite this they still live partly in villages. Were not impovrished. 

#### Yayoi Period (300 BCE - 300 CE)
New technologies are introduced. Important ones are wet rice agriculture taken from China. Metal work, copper and iron at the same time which is unique. Due to water rights there is need for governments.  

#### Tumulas Period
300-552. Centralization increased. Nara state introduced which will later be considered Japan. More accumulation of power. Emergence of Yamato State. 

#### Period of continental cultural import
552 - 710. More things from China & Korea. Writing using Chinese characters. Buddism (552), monumental architecture and governing techniques. First legal code 600-700, slowly dies off. 

Prince Shotoku. 574 - 622. Regent for empress. Established Buddhism and court ranks. Also introduces 17 article constitution. Nihon? 

#### Nara Period 
710 - 784. First permanent captial at Nara. Emperors have political power, and Japan is open. 

2 important books during this time. Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. Tell myth histroy and propaganda. Kojiki in classical Japanese, while Nihon Shoki in classical Chinese. 

## Heian Period
794 - 1192. Emporers and court slowly lose power. Flowering of culture. Comparatively closed. 

Fujiwara was an important power close to center of power during Heian period. Kept power by marrying away daughters. 2 problems with this: expensive to uphold and reproduction problems. Relations drift apart under time. Rule from behind emperors. 

Some example of culture: Tale of Genji. The pillow - Book of Sei Shanagon. Poetry. Okagami. 

Tales of Heike was 1000 page story of Tiara families rise and fall. Performed by blind musicians using Biwa.

In the end of Heian periods families arise to oppose the Fujiwara. Taira and Minamoto. 

## Kamakura Period
1192 - 1333. Yoritomo in power at first. Power concentrated in eastern Japan. After death wife takes over power. Rules as regents for Shogun. Is the first government by samurai. 

Order of power during Kamakura period: 
* Shogunal regents
* Shogun
* Emperor
* Imperial regents 
* Regional lords who are under Shogun


Mongolians try to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281. Samurai help defend Japan, both times Mongol fleet is destroyed by typhoons. The Shogun promise the Samurai land for fighting, but they do not get it because no new land is conquered. Discontent. 

During Kamakura period there are different types of Buddhism. 
* Shinran: Pure land schools. Amida Buddha, Namu Amida Butsu.
* Nichiren: Nichiren schools. Achieve salvation through devotion to the Lotus Sutra.
* Dogen: Zen schools. 

## Muromachi Period
1333 - 1573. Second Shogunate. Overlap with warring states period. 

During the Kennmu restoration emperor Go-daigo is restored to power in 1333, but does not award warriors, this leads to him losing power. Ashikaga Takauji becomes Shogun in 1338 by kicikg out Go-daigo. 

Japan has 2 emperors. Yoshimitsu (Third Shogun) reunited the 2 courts. Relations with China, trades, China gives him the title of king. He gets title of king. 

After Yoshimitsu dies we get civil war. Is called the Onin Rebellion 1467 - 1477, largely fought in Kyoto, shoguns are increasingly powerless. Called the warring states period. 

During 16th century Japan becomes part of trade routes in SEA, causing Japanese people to settle in other parts of Asia. 

European traders are seen as both a opportunity and a threat. Japan are afraid of being colonized. 

Japan also sees European religions as a threat. Therefore bans Christianity in 1630. 

## Tokugawa/Edo Period
1600 - 1868. After Onin rebellion Muromachi lose power. Japan needs a unifier!

3 unifiers: 
* Oda Nobunaga - Violent
* Toyotomi Hideyoshi - Irretating 
* Tokugawa Ieyasu - Patient

Nobunaga uses guns and gunpower and the power of trade to win over last Muromachi shogun in 1573, started in 1560. On his way to unify Japan but gets betrayed and killed by vassal in 1582. Toyotomi Hideyoshi takes over and defeats the vassal and unifies Japan. Hideyoshi invades Korea and brings scientists and pottery. Tokugawa Ieyasu is vassal of Nobunaga, serves as regent's concil for Hideyoshi's son. Keeps forces in Japan instead of invading Korea. After battle at Sekigahara in 1600 Ieyasu wins and becomes Shogun in 1603. Defeats Hideyoshi's son in 1615. Tries to build stable system. 

Tokugawa political order: Shoguns in Edo (Tokyo) rule directly over parts of Japan. 20% is ruled by Tokugawa, rest by feudal lords. Dangerous lords far away. Everyone has to live in Edo every other year. 

During this time Japan is more closed, but still allows trade with countries which are opportunities. 

Tokugawa social order (SPAM), sometimes called "container society": 
* Samurai
* Peasants
* Artisans
* Merchants

The 47 loyal retainers is a story (1703).

Economic problems: 
In the start econ is based on rice, but the merchants develop a cash economy. This leads to merchants gaining more and more money. 

Edo culture: 
* Ukiyoe: Genre of Japanese art, popular culture not high culture. 
* Puppet theater
* Kabuki: Live action theater. 
* Haiku: 17 syllable poem, 5-7-5. Season words, cutting words. Matsuo Basho elevates the Haiku from pastime to high art. 

Motoori Norinaga gives Japan its own identity. He studied the Kojiki and didn't like China. 

Tokugawa Shogunate falls when the can't solve chronic deficit. The prestige of the regime declines. And traditional enemies band together and pose threat. At the same time there is mass famine and US fleets arrive (Matthew Perry). 

## Meiji Restoration
1868-1945. New Meiji government. 

Tokugawa shogunate falls. 

Two groups are created. Sonno Joi - Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians (note that this is not the barbarians we are usually thinking of). And Kaikoko Sabaki: Open the country and aid the Shogunate. Sonno Joi win, new slogan "Rick Country and Strong Military", and "Civilization and Enlightenment". Result is that Meiji emperor gets power. 

Japan borrows a lot for the west but change to make it fit. 

Meiji changes: 
* Domains abolished
* SPAM gone
* Freedom of movement 
* Conscription, all men have to join military. Leads to standard Japanese. 
* Compulsory education.
* Right to property
* New forms of industrial production - Silk, cloth, large quantity
* New forms for time measurement - Use of western calendar. Switch 1873. 
* Currency is unified (Yen)
* National postal service
* Modern infrastructure - Trains
* Meritocracy

Saigo Takamori tried to overthrow Meiji government, fails. 

Fukozawa Yukichi studies Dutch and English. Educator and independent thinker 1834 - 1901.

New imperial constitution comes into effect in 1890, is replaced in 1947. Choose Prussian model instead of Westminster. Is the first Asian constitution. Can't be criticized as a gift from emperor. Establishes a bicameral parliament. "Real" democracy in 1920. 

Government is ruled by Meiji oligarchs but as these die off Hara Kei (a commoner) becomes PM. 


Sino Japanese war 1894-5. Defeat Xing empire in China. China is no longer the center of Asia. 

Russo war - 1904-5. First defeat of western power. Japan takes Korea. 

1932-1945 political instability. 11 men from 13 cabinets, no political stability, no oligarchs. Military increase distance from civilian life. Hard to understand each other. Military commit terrorism and kill pm. 

Important war dates during 15 year war: 
* 1931 - Conquest of Manchuria
* 1937 - Fighting spreads to rest of China
* 1941 - Pearl Harbor
* 1945 Fire bombings in Japanese cities, atomic bombings, surrender. 

## Postwar Japan
After the second world Japan is devastated but they manage to rebuild quickly. 

1945 - Devastated
1960 - Econ very good
1980 - Economic "miracle" according to US, but in reality hard work

The economic growth actually started in late 1930s but then stopped during the war. In 1952 Japan is back to pre war size. 

After the war many cities are devastated, some city 7mil in 1940 to 3 min in 1945. About 50% of all building are destroyed. 

In 1945 there is a bad harvest, US supply food but this is not optimal as their food is very different. 

Prices of food skyrocket, in 1932 33% of income is spent on food, in 1947 it is 70%! 

After the war a black market breaks out, declines after the war but still available in 1950s. 

North Korea invades South Korea in 1950, the US joins the South's side, this is good for Japan as they get many manufacturing jobs. 

After the war America has control over Japan, they make many changes, they write a new constitution. Give power to the local government, but a lot of the burocracy from 1868 is till left. 

## Religion
The word religion works well for western fates, but not as good for Japan. 

Orphopraxic - Religious experiences - What we're going to talk about in regards to Japan. Not "religious" but practices "religion". 

At first there was Shinto/Indigenous religion. Some argue that before Buddhism there was no Shinto, as it was only a natural part of life.

Buddhism - Reached Japan during the Nara period. Nara Daibutsi built. Many leave for Kyoto to get away from Buddhism. In old Kyoto all shrines were outside city walls in Kyoto.

Kamakura Buddhism: 
* Shinran: Pure land school. Shinran was a normal person, has a family.
* Nichiren: Nichiren schools, Lotus sutra
* Dogen: Zen schools

Japan has Nativist learnings. Motoori Norinaga. These focus on Japanese identity. Return to "Pure Japanese" culture. Writing for Japan, Kojiki not Nihongi, not exactly a religion but religion like. Kojiki is seen as the absolute truth. Norinaga spends 30 years reading Kojiki. Wants to restore power to emperor.

Syncretism: Mixing of religion, ideas or cultures. Think Buddhism + Daoism. This was not seen as a problem and was normal before 1868. Example is how death was associated with Buddhism and life and fruitfulness with Shinto. 

Religions of Japan: 
* Buddhism
* Shinto
* Confucianism
* Daoism
* Folk regligion
* New Religions
* Christianity & other

New religions:  Arise in the chaos of the late Tokugawa period and after. Often founded by charismatic leaders.

Tenrikyo: A religion founded by Nakayama Miki (1798 - 1887). Miki has a powerful religious persona, she was good at healing others, helped women give birth. Miki was thrown in jail multiple times. Religion still present in Japan today. 

During Meiji restoration Shinto and Buddhism is split. State Shinto is created, this is then stopped by US in 1945. Was never finalized, built piece by piece. Is obligation of citizens, those who don't listen get thrown in jail. "Not religion, but obligation". This changes the conception of religion in Japan. 

In 1945 new US constitution, says separation of church and state. This does not make sense for Japan and leads to religious spiritual chaos. In this time many new religions arise. Older New Religions also become popular. Might be a way to deal with the chaos of the postwar years.  

Soka Gakkai: New religion founded in 1930. Based on Nichiren ideas. Sees massive growth after WW2. Don't participate in Shinto and are not syncretic, did not participate in state Shinto. Get kicked out of Nichiren in 1991. Politically active, now officially independent.

New religions have often had antagonistic relationship with mainstream society.

Aum Shinrikyo: Om supreme truth religion. Founded by Asahara Shoko, born Matsumoto Chizuo. Ahahara is nearly blind, practitioner of yoga, charismatic. He goes to blind school, but he has slightly better vision than other kids so bully. Teaches learns yoga. 

Why people choose to follow Aum Shinrikyo:
* Charisma of Asahara Shoko
* Religious vision
* Escape from "normal" life
* Chance to be important
* No need to think for self. Clear path to enlightenment. Just follow. Also blueprint for life. 
* Or maybe none of the above, we don't know.

Aum Shinrikyo is syncretic, Mahayana Buddhism + Tibetan Buddhism + Yogic practices from Hinduism + "Science" + Christian notions of armageddon + folk religion. 

Aum Shinrikyo carry out serrin attacks on subway in 1995. 12-13 people are killed, 5000-6000 sickened. Aum Shinrikyo have also killed lawyers and other before this. Asahara Shoko executed in 2018. 

Things to note about Aum Shinrikyo:
* Aum != Japanese religion
* Syncretism != Terrorism
* Postwar reforms make it hard for the government to move against Aum Shinrikyo. 

## Culture
Kabuki is a form of theater. It goes from pop to high culture, readily available in Japan today. Was the first genre by commoners for commoners. 

Commoner culture: Passed down from generation to generation, still influences life today.

Examples of Commoner culture: 
* Woodblock prints: First pop culture, then seen as high culture by foreigners. 
* Kibyoshi: Manga for Edo people, tell complex stories.
* Rakugo - Story telling. 

In Edo era No-drame was high culture, this got boring for the commoners. Haiku is pop culture.

Izumo no Okuni created Kabuki, at first they were gender bending comedies. Started in Kyoto near the riverbeds, dirty dancing. Samurai often start fights over who gets to bring women back home, leads to deaths, this annoys Tokugawa Shogunate, so women are thrown off stage in 1629. Young men take their spot, but same thing happens. So young men also thrown off stage 1652. This only leaves middle aged men, can't sell using sex appeal so plays must instead be more interesting in other ways. This improves music, length, story, actors become more specialized. The Kabuki actors become popular, but no part of SPAM. The Kobuki stage is advanced, Hanamichi is part which extends out into crowd. They way to write the word Kabuki has changed, in Tokugawa one character meant prostitute, after Tokugawa instead skill. 

The Kabuki we saw: Tells a story from Tales of Heike, but it is told differently. We see Buddhism, Tokugawa ethics and sensibilities. 

## Women in Japan
In Europe no female writers until middle ages. Also not a lot of famous writers in China before modernity. Females play critical role in Japan. Female write in Japanese characters while males write in Chinese, which leads to men not as emotionally nuanced. 

Before Heian period many famous female writers, not as many after, but always a few. Murasaki Shikibu wrote The Tale of Genji.

Judith Butler argues that gender is performed. Punishment for those that don't follow assigned gender. 

Himiko is first ruler of Japan known by name. She was spiritual Shaman, brother helps her rule but she is ruler. 

Many empresses, usually male served behind the throne. Princess Shotoku was powerful ruler (note not prince Shotoku). 

Tomoe Gozen is 12th century female warrior, might be fictional.

Women have a lot of power into Kamakura period, could inherit and own property. Hojo Masako leads Kamakura Shogunate at start. Buddhism one reason for decline as it's very sexist, women can't reach enlightenment until reborn as men. Confucianism also contributes to decline. Right disappear slowly, so not as noticeable.  At end of Kamakura they can't own property anymore. 

Examples of female's lower social standing: 
* Mikudari-han: Men have sole right to divorce, only need to write 3.5 lines. Women could force the issue by asking for help from family.
* Peasants: Women are important in household economics. 
* Samurai: Parental & confucian women have few rights and no space.
* Note that there was great geographical variation.

Onna Daigaun: Is a guide for teaching women how to follow upper class rules.
