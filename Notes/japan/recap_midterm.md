For this midterm we will cover the history of Japan up until modern time. 

## Early Japanese periods 

#### Jomon Period (10000 BCE - 300 BCE)
The people in Japan live in hunter gatherer societies, despite this they still live partly in villages. Were not impovrished. 

#### Yayoi Period (300 BCE - 300 CE)
New technologies are introduced. Important ones are wet rice agriculture taken from China. Metal work, copper and iron at the same time which is unique. Due to water rights there is need for governments.  

#### Tumulas Period
300-552. Centralization increased. Nara state introduced which will later be considered Japan. More accumulation of power. Emergence of Yamato State. 

#### Period of continental cultural import
552 - 710. More things from China & Korea. Writing using Chinese characters. Buddism (552), monumental architecture and governing techniques. First legal code 600-700, slowly dies off. 

Prince Shotoku. 574 - 622. Regent for empress. Established Buddhism and court ranks. Also introduces 17 article constitution. Nihon? 

#### Nara Period 
710 - 784. First permanent captial at Nara. Emperors have political power, and Japan is open. 

2 important books during this time. Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. Tell myth histroy and propaganda. Kojiki in classical Japanese, while Nihon Shoki in classical Chinese. 

## Heian Period
794 - 1192. Emporers and court slowly lose power. Flowering of culture. Comparatively closed. 

Fujiwara was an important power close to center of power during Heian period. Kept power by marrying away daughters. 2 problems with this: expensive to uphold and reproduction problems. Relations drift apart under time. Rule from behind emperors. 

Some example of culture: Tale of Genji. The pillow - Book of Sei Shanagon. Poetry. Okagami. 

Tales of Heike was 1000 page story of Tiara families rise and fall. Performed by blind musicians using Biwa.

In the end of Heian periods families arise to oppose the Fujiwara. Taira and Minamoto. 

## Kamakura Period
1192 - 1333. Yoritomo in power at first. Power concentrated in eastern Japan. After death wife takes over power. Rules as regents for Shogun. Is the first government by samurai. 

Order of power during Kamakura period: 
* Shogunal regents
* Shogun
* Emperor
* Imperial regents 
* Regional lords who are under Shogun


Mongolians try to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281. Samurai help defend Japan, both times Mongol fleet is destroyed by typhoons. The Shogun promise the Samurai land for fighting, but they do not get it because no new land is conquered. Discontent. 

During Kamakura period there are different types of Buddhism. 
* Shinran: Pure land schools. Amida Buddha, Namu Amida Butsu.
* Nichiren: Nichiren schools. Achieve salvation through devotion to the Lotus Sutra.
* Dogen: Zen schools. 

## Muromachi Period
1333 - 1573. Second Shogunate. Overlap with warring states period. 

During the Kennmu restoration emperor Go-daigo is restored to power in 1333, but does not award warriors, this leads to him losing power. Ashikaga Takauji becomes Shogun in 1338 by kicikg out Go-daigo. 

Japan has 2 emperors. Yoshimitsu (Third Shogun) reunited the 2 courts. Relations with China, trades, China gives him the title of king. He gets title of king. 

After Yoshimitsu dies we get civil war. Is called the Onin Rebellion 1467 - 1477, largely fought in Kyoto, shoguns are increasingly powerless. Called the warring states period. 

During 16th century Japan becomes part of trade routes in SEA, causing Japanese people to settle in other parts of Asia. 

European traders are seen as both a opportunity and a threat. Japan are afraid of being colonized. 

Japan also sees European religions as a threat. Therefore bans Christianity in 1630. 

## Tokugawa/Edo Period
1600 - 1868. After Onin rebellion Muromachi lose power. Japan needs a unifier!

3 unifiers: 
* Oda Nobunaga - Violent
* Toyotomi Hideyoshi - Irretating 
* Tokugawa Ieyasu - Patient

Nobunaga uses guns and gunpower and the power of trade to win over last Muromachi shogun in 1573, started in 1560. On his way to unify Japan but gets betrayed and killed by vassal in 1582. Toyotomi Hideyoshi takes over and defeats the vassal and unifies Japan. Hideyoshi invades Korea and brings scientists and pottery. Tokugawa Ieyasu is vassal of Nobunaga, serves as regent's concil for Hideyoshi's son. Keeps forces in Japan instead of invading Korea. After battle at Sekigahara in 1600 Ieyasu wins and becomes Shogun in 1603. Defeats Hideyoshi's son in 1615. Tries to build stable system. 

Tokugawa political order: Shoguns in Edo (Tokyo) rule directly over parts of Japan. 20% is ruled by Tokugawa, rest by feudal lords. Dangerous lords far away. Everyone has to live in Edo every other year. 

During this time Japan is more closed, but still allows trade with countries which are opportunities. 

Tokugawa social order (SPAM), sometimes called "container society": 
* Samurai
* Peasants
* Artisans
* Merchants

The 47 loyal retainers is a story (1703).

Economic problems: 
In the start econ is based on rice, but the merchants develop a cash economy. This leads to merchants gaining more and more money. 

Edo culture: 
* Ukiyoe: Genre of Japanese art, popular culture not high culture. 
* Puppet theater
* Kabuki: Live action theater. 
* Haiku: 17 syllable poem, 5-7-5. Season words, cutting words. Matsuo Basho elevates the Haiku from pastime to high art. 

Motoori Norinaga gives Japan its own identity. He studied the Kojiki and didn't like China. 

Tokugawa Shogunate falls when the can't solve chronic deficit. The prestige of the regime declines. And traditional enemies band together and pose threat. At the same time there is mass famine and US fleets arrive (Matthew Perry). 


## Meiji Period
1868-1945. New Meiji government. 

Tokugawa shogunate falls. 

Two groups are created. Sonno Joi - Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians (note that this is not the barbarians we are usually thinking of). And Kaikoko Sabaki: Open the country and aid the Shogunate. New slogan is "revere the emperor and expel the barbarians". Result is that Meiji emperor gets power. 

Japan borrows a lot for the west but change to make it fit. 

Meiji changes: 
* Domains abolished
* SPAM gone
* Freedom of movement 
* Conscription, all men have to join military. Leads to standard Japanese. 
* Compulsory education.
* Right to property
* New forms of industrial production - Silk, cloth, large quantity

New imperial constitution comes into effect in 1890, is replaced in 1947. Choose Prussian model instead of Westminster. Is the first Asian constitution. Can't be criticized as a gift from emperor. Establishes a bicameral parliament. "Real" democracy in 1920. 

Government is ruled by Meiji oligarchs but as these die off Hara Kei (a commoner) becomes PM. 


Sino Japanese war 1894-5. Defeat Xing empire in China. 

Russo war - 1904-5. First defeat of western power. Japan takes Korea. 

1932-1945 political instability. 11 men from 13 cabinets, no political stability, no oligarchs. Military increase distance from civilian life. Hard to understand each other. Military commit terrorism and kill pm.
