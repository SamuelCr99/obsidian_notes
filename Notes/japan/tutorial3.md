What are the elements of a good history?

**Group discussion**
* Different perspectives from groups with different motives? 
* Does the person writing the history have anything to gain from spreading this history? 
* Who has the capability to tell history? 
* Is it the winner who is writing the history? 
* Does the history show both sides? This is extra important in questions where there are two clear sides. 
* Stories may distort facts to enhance. 
* No gaps. 

**Class discussion**
* Majority of history is only 1 source or story. But we can still read for biases. But there are people we can tune out. 
* Facts.
* Trust authority but also question them. 
* Narrative. 
* Context.
