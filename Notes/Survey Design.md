# Survey Design
Goal is to find the satisfaction of products sold by a company. So they want to create a survey. There will be two graphs, one with customers and one with products. 

We want to ask different questions to different customers, but we do not wish to ask too many. Between $c_i$ and $c_{i}'$ are questions to customer i. We here add a start and a sink.
