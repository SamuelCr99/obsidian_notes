# Tips for Algorithms
## Graphs
* The MST is the tree with the cheapest edges so all nodes are connected. When considering if a MST will be the same between two different trees simply try running the calculations. 
* The shortest path between two nodes will not necessarily be unique. 
* To find a cycle remember that we can go backwards. 
* Remember to run topological ordering. 

## Greedy
* An exchange argument means that we assume that we have an optimal solution, then if we can change our optimal solution back into our greedy solution without making the solution worse (or not valid) then we know our greedy solution is valid. 

## Dynamic Programming 
* In DP we can use backtracking to know how we reached our solution. 

## NP
* When deciding if something is NP complete we have to verify two different thing, first if it can be verified in polynomial time, and secondly if we can reduce a known a NP-complete problem to our problem.
